1.1 Human Patch Extraction - extract human image patches and store
1.2 Classify Patches - Classify each of the images into 5 categories
1.3 Training Data selection - Select the best images form style transfer
1.4 Training Data Augmentation - develop an augmentation method

2.1 Model Deployment - Download a pretrained cycle GAN
2.2 Model Turing - tune the cycle GAN of our data
2.3 Part-based transfer - tune model to only apply style transfer to parts of the image

3.1 Results Analysis - Apply best model to test data
3.2 Pipeline - if you had access to the whole game rendering pipeline, how could you make the model better?
