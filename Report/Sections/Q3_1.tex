The background model does a good job at preserving detail, and it produces relatively movie like results.
Darker game scenes are the main challenge faced by this model.
They tend to produce a brown output, whereas lighter scene produce a much more convincing effect.
This could be rectified by including more nighttime movie training data.

The patch model doesn't perform as well as the background model.
There are many artifacts in the patch model output, and a lack of detail overall.
A more fine grain approach may have proven valuable, for example, we could have created: torso, hands, face, e.t.c classes, then trained, aligning these classes.
The both models also lacks any temporal constancy, leading to flickering.
