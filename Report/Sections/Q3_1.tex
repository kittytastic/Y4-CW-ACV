The background model does a good job at preserving detail, and produces somewhat movie like results.
Darker game scenes are the main challenge faced by this model, producing a brown output, whereas lighter scene produce a much more convincing effect.
This could be rectified by including more nighttime movie training data.

The patch model doesn't perform as well.
There are many artifacts, and an overall lack of detail.
A more fine grain approach may help, for example, we could have created: torso, hands, face, e.t.c classes, then trained, aligning these classes.

Both models also lacks any temporal constancy, leading to flickering.
