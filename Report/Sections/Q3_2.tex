Thr first issue we could tackle is that of lighting.
Access to the rendering pipeline would allow the rendering of day and nighttime clips, we could use these for training and pair them against labeled day and night movie clips.
Additionally we could pair brightened night images with darkened day images.

Also, we could replace the patch model.
Instead we could train a model to transform a game model's texture to the movie domain.
Then we can apply this texture to the model.
This would solve the issue of human model temporal constancy.
